# Remaining tasks
- Documentation of docker directory and each image
- Docker Bench Security related hardening
- More Nginx hardening and configuration
- SSL/TLS

    possibly use https://github.com/aptible/supercronic instead
    maybe use different base image (Ubuntu maybe?)
- Review PHP configuration and any hardening
- MariaDB hardening
- Update test script/images with latest additions

# Docker Bench Security hardening:
- Ensure containers are restricted from acquiring new privileges
- Ensure memory usage for container is limited: Container running without memory restrictions
- Ensure CPU priority is set appropriately on the container: Container running without CPU restrictions
- Ensure incoming container traffic is binded to a specific host interface: Port being bound to wildcard IP: 0.0.0.0 in docker-php-drupal-template_nginx_1
- Ensure 'on-failure' container restart policy is set to '5': MaximumRetryCount is not set to 5
- Ensure the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges
- Add health checks
- Container PID limit
