# File: example.remote.site.yml
#
# This is an example Drush site alias configuration for a dev, test, live
# setup on a remote server.
#
# In this example when using Drush site alias commands you would use:
#   @remote.dev
#   @remote.test
#   @remote.live
#
# To use these aliases:
# 1. Copy this file and name it `remote.site.yml`.
# 2. Set `host` and `user` as appropriate for each environment.
# 2. Change the `drush-script` path below for each environment to point to the
#    absolute path of the `drush-launcher` script on the remote server.
#    Note: this is the script found in the `/drush` folder. So if this project
#    is stored at `/srv/example.com/web` on the remote server, set `drush-script`
#    to `/srv/example.com/drush/drush-launcher`.
#
# To test the site aliases, you can run `./cli drush @remote.live status`.
#
# See https://www.drush.org/13.x/site-aliases/ for more information on how
# to setup and use Drush site aliases.
